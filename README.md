Aspin [ˈʔas.pɪn], short for Asong Pinoy, is a term used for mixed-breed street dogs.

Why create another passphrase generator? 

I wanted to create a passphrase generator that focuses on Philippine dialects as its wordlists -- "mixing" words, separators, case, and others to generate a more secure passphrase. This passphrase generator has the generic features of specifying the word count, word case, and separator. In addition, it also supports character substitution, separator multiplier, and inclusion of randomized numbers and/or special characters.
Furthermore, this allowed me to practice my Python skills and at the same time contribute to the information security knowledge body.

I also included a folder of my photographs to raise awareness to aspins.
