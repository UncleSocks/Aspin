# Aspin: Filipino-centric Passphrase Generator
Why create another passphrase generator? 

I wanted to create a passphrase generator that focuses on Philippine dialects as its wordlists. This passphrase generator has the generic features of specifying the word count, word case, and separator; this also supports character substitution, separator multiplier, and inclusion of randomized numbers and/or special characters.
Furthermore, this allowed me to practice my Python skills and at the same time contribute to the information security knowledge body.
